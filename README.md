## Introduction

> These excerpts are taken from the biography of Harden Croft, a professional cyclist. They were paragraphs of interest in regards to the Nano-Doping which was so prevalent while he was racing. The retrospective tests showed that since the third season he was involved in a bio-tech enhancement that helped him win the three grand tours. The autobiography is released in a few months, called "Uphill: Upgraded", is his first time discussing the issue in public.

> This is the second auto-biography written by Harden Croft. His first "Three in a Year, Four in a Failure" brought him much acclaim and he was very strong in his advocacy of being anti-drugs in sport. This new auto-biography, which was released due to revelations of his blood-doping, goes into much more detail than we have excepted here and we encourage you to pick it up as it comes out. The revelations contained within go on to name cyclists and other professional athletes involved in this bio-tech enhancements.
